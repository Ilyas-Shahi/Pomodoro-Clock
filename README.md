The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks - 5 minutes.

## Features

- User can see a timer for 25 minutes - the **working** session
- After the **working** session is over, the User can see a timer for 5 minutes - the **break** session
- User can _start_ / _pause_, _stop_ and _reset_ the timers
- User can hear a sound playing when the timer hits `00:00` - denoting that the session has ended
- User can change / customize the minutes in both sessions before starting
